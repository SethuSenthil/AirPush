 ## FAQ
 # Do I need to setup airmessage?
 Yes you must have airmessage installed on your macos computer and setup. AirPush works with AirMessage.
 # "It dosent connect"
 Retry using a different random port number. If it still dosen't work, check if airmessage works on your local network (home wifi) as it may not be an AirPush issue and instead an AirMessage issue. Try re-downloading a fresh copy of AirPush again, it may have been updated.
# It's stuck at 50%
 If you see a progress indacator on your status bar "stuck" at 50 - don't worry! It's intended to work this way.
